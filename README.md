OneBankâ€™s aim is to unite the online banking experience by linking multiple banking accounts and
aggregating relevant information for the users. Users who have banking accounts across multiple banks
would greatly benefit from OneBank. Users will no longer need to access multiple websites or applications
to have a grasp of their financial standing. OneBank is designed from the ground up while considering 
usability and user experience at every corner of the product to provide a pleasant and intuitive online 
banking experience.
